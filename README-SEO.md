# SEO Setup for Google Search Results

This document explains how to get your website to show up in Google search results with sitelinks and rich snippets like Y Combinator.

## What We've Implemented

### 1. Structured Data (JSON-LD)
- **Organization Schema**: Defines your company information
- **WebSite Schema**: Helps Google understand your site structure
- **Service Schema**: Describes your services for rich snippets

### 2. Enhanced Metadata
- Open Graph tags for social sharing
- Twitter Card metadata
- Proper canonical URLs
- Keywords and descriptions

### 3. Sitemap
- Automatically generated at `/sitemap.xml`
- Includes all pages with priorities and change frequencies

### 4. Robots.txt
- Generated at `/robots.txt`
- Tells search engines what to crawl

## Next Steps to Get Indexed

### 1. Update Domain
Replace `solospark.mn` with your actual domain in:
- `app/layout.tsx` (metadataBase)
- `app/components/StructuredData.tsx` (all URLs)
- `app/sitemap.ts` (baseUrl)
- `app/robots.ts` (sitemap URL)

### 2. Submit to Google Search Console
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Add your property (domain)
3. Verify ownership
4. Submit your sitemap: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`

### 3. Create OG Image
Create an image at `public/og-image.png` (1200x630px) for social sharing.

### 4. Update Contact Information
Update phone number and social media links in `app/components/StructuredData.tsx`

### 5. Build Internal Links
Make sure your footer and navigation link to all important pages (already done).

### 6. Wait for Indexing
- Google typically indexes within a few days to weeks
- Sitelinks appear after Google understands your site structure
- Rich snippets appear when structured data is validated

## Testing Your Setup

- You cannot force sitelinks, but good structure helps
- It may take weeks or months for sitelinks to appear
